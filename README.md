# specanneca

This is a Rust implementation of my previous python program SpecAnCellularAutomata. There is still work to be done with this:

1. Have curve fit to the function instead of the fit being hard coded

2. isolate out the columns that are just there for simplicity of coding.

3. Anything else that I find along the way.
